enum DamageType
{
    Melee,
    Range,
    Magic          //capitilize first letter
}


// this is an enum a way to store melee range magic so there is no mispelling.
// these are actually numbers, but it feels like we have a special string
// to compare with. 
// These can be looped through. Lots of advantages to enums
